To run the script, you will first need to clone the dsci510-lab1 repository to your local repository. You can accomplish this using Github, Github Desktop, or a command line. To clone a repo using the command line, type $ git clone <url>. You can also specify a name for the directory where your local repo will be saved, which is simply included as an additional argument (ex. $ git clone https://github.com/dbmay91/dsci510-lab1.git myLibGit). Once you have successfully cloned the files to your local repository, open a command line and use the 'cd' command to navigate to the directory where the file is saved. You can use the 'pwd' command to print your working directory, and you can use the 'ls' command to list the folders/files that are found in your current working directory. Once in the right directory, type $ python3 lab1.py. This should run the script, and you should see the output 'Welcome to DSCI510!'
